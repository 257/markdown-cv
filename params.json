Can't remember how to set margins in your TeX file? Refusing to compromise and use Word?_\r\n\r\nMeet **markdown-cv**, a simple template to list all your accomplishments in a readable [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file and use CSS to style it. \r\n\r\nTo start, simply fork the repository and type your skills, jobs and education in the `index.md` file. \r\n\r\nThen let your local installation of [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) do the work of transforming your plain text CV into a beautiful looking HTML page.\r\n\r\nPrint and web [CSS media queries](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/goingtoprint/) mean that to get a PDF you can just press print in your favourite browser.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe included CSS renders CV in a style inspired by [kjhealy's vita template](http://kjhealy.github.com/kjh-vita/), but any styling is possible.
